# Contributing to the HotKV Gateway

Thank you for your interest in improving this package. Bug reports, fixes and
documentation improvements are welcome.

## Reporting problems

- Bugs and feature requests: open an issue on the
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/hotkv-ltd/hotkv-gateway/issues) and fill in
  the template. Include the hotkv-gateway version, your Go version if you built it,
  the HotKV server version and a minimal way to reproduce the problem.
- Security vulnerabilities: do not open a public issue. Follow
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Making a change

1. For anything larger than a small fix, open an issue first so the approach can
   be agreed before you spend time on it.
2. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
3. Keep the change focused. The gateway sits in front of every LLM call, so a change must never make a request fail because the cache did, never serve one caller's answer to another, and never store an error.
4. Add or update tests for the behavior you change.
5. Run the checks below and make sure they pass.
6. Open a pull request against `main` and describe what changed and why.

## Checks

These need no server:

```bash
gofmt -l .          # prints nothing
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
```

The live tests need a running HotKV server and are skipped unless `HOTKV_TEST_URL` is set. They use
a random key prefix, but run them only against a throwaway server.
